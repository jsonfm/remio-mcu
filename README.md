```bash
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate
```

### Dependencies
After you set the virutal env, you should install dependencies as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Mockup GUI
This experiment uses PyQt5 framework to provide a GUI.
```
python gui.py
```

### Run Mockup without GUI (Production)
This experiment also, could be controlled remotly, then you probably not want to use the local gui.

```
python production.py
```
### SocketIO Server
A socketio server was added for do some tests.
```
python run_server.py
```
